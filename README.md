# Neural-Network
The neural network is a machine learning technique modeled after how our brains work, i.e. with neurons and synapses. This repository holds a neural network class programmed in java that can be used in conjunction with the back propogation class or the genetic code class in a program to train the neural network to accomplish a task, whatever that might be. Currently, there are two example programs, "HelloWorld.java" and "WordAI.java". Ignore my bad naming sense. The first example has a variable called "target" that you can set to any string, and the program will use the genetic algorithm neural network to print that string out to the console. The second example has you typing into a scanner a call, and then how the network should respond. The network uses backpropogation to essentially hardwire itself to respond to those specific calls. These two are merely examples and aren't meant to actually be useful, however, I believe they're pretty neat in their own way.
