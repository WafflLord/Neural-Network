# Neural-Network
This is a commonly used machine learning technique known as a neural network. It is based off of how our brains work. It takes input data, sends it through layers of neurons, and outputs different values for each neuron in the last layer, in which (usually) the label given to the neuron with the highest value is the answer the network gives. This neural network is a first attempt to program a neural network in Java, and as such, is not as refined as it could be (just give it a bit and I'll update it with changes to make it go faster). Currently, I've also put in a class called HelloWorld in which you can type in the target sentence you wish the network to repeat back. When the network itself is a bit more refined, there will most likely be other main methods to see the AI work.
